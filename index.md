Every three seconds, the flying mosquito will change a random number and an arithmetic type. You need to catch the mosquitoes that meet the requirements according to different numbers. When you click the capture button, the number of mosquitoes you catch will be calculated based on the accumulated amount. When the number you catch is less than 50, it's safe. When it's more than 80, it will show dangerous yellow. When you catch more than 100 mosquitoes or less than - 100 mosquitoes, the game resolves. You can practice your fast computing ability in this process and enjoy the fun of arithmetic.
